# JiraManager

Application name is not yet adequate, but eventually this application is thought to provide functionality useful for: Scrum Masters, Administrators, JIRA Power Users. Currently application has following features:
* Search for issues
* Basic reporting based on Pivot Grid filled with found issues
* Generation of cards for Scrum Board with found issues. 

## How to install

Please download latest release from: https://github.com/sceeter89/jira-manager/releases and extract to desired directory. Then run JiraManager.exe file to start. Once you log in to your JIRA your session will be stored, but your password will not be saved anywhere. What it implies - once your session expires (e.g. due to server restart) you will need to log in again.

## Feedback

## Development

JiraManager makes great use of Telerik controls for WPF, so to build it you will need these controls installed (http://www.telerik.com/products/wpf/overview.aspx).
